After my Dad and Aunt's Parkinson's diagnosis, I knew I had to do something to help so I created Park.

Park is an app to empower Parkinson's patients with detailed analytics, enhancing on-device machine learning, growing gamification, and increasing continuity between doctor and patient.

Thank you to Elliot Kantor for his amazing work with the machine learning model.

After my Dad and Aunt's Parkinson's diagnosis, I knew I had to do something to help so I created Park.

Park is an app to empower Parkinson's patients with detailed analytics, enhancing on-device machine learning, growing gamification, and increasing continuity between doctor and patient.

We also created a machine learning model with 98% accuracy that may be able to predict Parkinson's using readily available data from Apple's Health app, however it's still early.

Thank you to my Dad and Aunt for their feedback on the app and Elliot Kantor for his amazing work with the machine learning model.
